# Specification Quality Checklist: Firebase Multi-Device Sync

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan` or `/speckit-implement`.
- This is the largest architecture change yet — local-only → cloud-synced.
- Backward compatible: users who don't sign up keep using localStorage.
- Firebase Firestore (not Realtime DB) for offline support + structured data.
- PIN stays local per-device (not synced to cloud).
- Server timestamps prevent clock manipulation for daily resets.
- Free tier sufficient for family use.
